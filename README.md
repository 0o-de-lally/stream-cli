# Stream CLI

ðŸš§ **Alpha Testing Notice**

This project is currently in **alpha testing**. It may contain bugs, and features are subject to change. Use caution when running this program, and do not use it with accounts holding significant funds.

---

Stream CLI is a command-line interface tool designed to automate the execution of crypto coin trades based on your strategy. It allows you to schedule trades over a 24-hour period, executing them at random times within specified windows, and adhering to user-defined parameters such as daily amount, number of trades, and minimum acceptable price.

## Features

- **Automated Trading**: Schedule and execute crypto trades based on your strategy.
- **Account Balance Query**: Easily query the balances of an account given its address.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Define daily amounts, number of trades, and minimum prices.
- **Randomized Execution Times**: Trades occur at random times within defined windows.
- **Osmosis Network Integration**: Currently supports the Osmosis blockchain network.
- **Detailed Transaction Logging**: Stores comprehensive transaction details for auditing.

## Installation

To install and run Stream CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Install dependencies**.

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential -y
sudo apt-get install pkg-config -y
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev -y
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

2. **Clone the repository**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/soaresa/stream-cli.git
```

3. **Navigate to the repository root directory**.

```bash
cd stream-cli
```

4. **Build the program**.

```bash
cargo build
```

## Usage

Stream CLI provides two main commands:

- **`stream`**: Automate your trading strategy by scheduling trades.
- **`balance`**: Query the balances of an account given its address.

### **Stream Command**

To start the streaming trades, use the `stream` subcommand with the appropriate options. You can choose to specify either the amount of tokens you want to **obtain** (via `--daily-amount-out`) or the amount of tokens you want to **sell** (via `--daily-amount-in`).

#### Options:

- `--daily-amount-out`: The total amount of tokens you wish to **obtain** per day.
- `--daily-amount-in`: The total amount of tokens you wish to **sell** per day.
- `--daily-streams`: The number of trades to be executed over 24 hours.
- `--min-price`: The minimum price you are willing to pay per token.

#### Examples:

- **Obtain 20 tokens over 4 trades per day** at a minimum price of 0.1 per token:

```bash
cargo run -- stream --daily-amount-out 20 --daily-streams 4 --min-price 0.1
```

- **Sell 1000 tokens over 4 trades per day**, with a target minimum price of 0.1 per token:

```bash
cargo run -- stream --daily-amount-in 1000 --daily-streams 4 --min-price 0.1
```

In these examples, the program will either aim to **obtain** 20 tokens throughout the day or **sell** 1000 tokens, executing trades across 4 intervals, depending on which option is provided (`amount-in` or `amount-out`).

### **Balance Command**

To query the balances of an account, use the `balance` subcommand:

```bash
cargo run -- balance --address <your_account_address>
```

- `--address`: The account address to query.

**Example:**

```bash
cargo run -- balance --address osmo1youraddresshere
```

### Initial Setup

1. **Enter Your Mnemonic:**

   Upon starting, the program will prompt you to enter your mnemonic (seed phrase). This is required to access your account for executing trades.

2. **Confirm Parameters:**

   The program will display:

   - The parameters you have provided.
   - The account address corresponding to your mnemonic.

   Confirm the details by typing `y` to start the program.

## How It Works

- **Time Division:**

  - The program divides the 24-hour period into the specified number of trade windows (e.g., 4 windows for 4 trades).
  - For each window, it selects a random time to execute the trade.

- **Trade Execution:**

  - At the scheduled time, the program checks:
    - If the current price of the input token is greater than or equal to the user-defined minimum price.
    - If your account has sufficient balance to execute the trade.

- **Retry Mechanism:**

  - If the conditions are not met, the program retries every 5 seconds until the end of the current window.
  - If the trade cannot be executed within the window, it is skipped.
  - A new window begins with a new random trade time.

## Transaction History

- **Storage Location:**

  - Transactions are stored in `~/stream/test/osmosis_transactions.json` or `~/stream/prod/osmosis_transactions.json`, depending on the environment.

- **Transaction Details:**

  Each transaction record includes:

  - `txhash`
  - `timestamp`
  - `pool_id`
  - `token_in`
  - `token_out`
  - `amount_out`
  - `min_price`
  - `tx_status` (broadcasted, executed, error, timeout)
  - `status_code`
  - `raw_log`
  - `gas_used`
  - `tokens_in`

- **Transaction Statuses:**

  - **broadcasted**: Transaction has been sent.
  - **executed**: Transaction was successful (`code` is 0).
  - **error**: Transaction failed (`code` is non-zero).
  - **timeout**: No response received within 60 seconds.

## Terminating the Program

To stop the program gracefully, press `Ctrl + C`. This will ensure the program completes its current operations before shutting down, preventing any unexpected interruptions or data loss.

## Limitations

- **Network Support**: Currently, Stream CLI only integrates with the Osmosis network.
- **Configuration**: Pool IDs and tokens for each environment are defined in the `constants.rs` module.

## Environments

- **Setting the Environment:**

  - Modify the `ENVIRONMENT` variable in the `.env` file at the root of the project.
  - Possible values:
    - `prod`: Uses the `osmosis-1` chain.
    - `test`: Uses the `osmo-test-5` chain.

## Warnings

- **Experimental Software**:

  - This repository is an experiment and may contain bugs.
  - Use caution when running this program.

- **Security Notice**:

  - You will need to provide your mnemonic (seed phrase).
  - Ensure you are in a secure environment to prevent compromising your account.

- **Responsibility**:

  - You are responsible for any actions taken by this program.
  - Use at your own risk.
